                        </p>
                        <p>Students must receive their confirmation e-mail before attending a NetSuite course.

Typically, blended learning days are broken into 2 blocks - live classroom lecture hours and independent study time, allowing you to work at your own pace with instructor support. Classes that are taught in the Blended Learning format will display "Blended Learning" as the location on the <a href="/portal/services/training/suite-training/schedule.shtml" data-linktrack="true" data-tracklinktext="courseSched">course schedule</a> page.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>When is the last day to register?</strong><br>
                           We recommend that students register as early as possible, as classes can fill quickly. Virtual Training registrations are only accepted until two business days prior to the session start date. 
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>How do I set up and attend my training session?</strong><br>
                           Setting up for your class and attending the session is easy. First, be sure you have received a course confirmation e-mail. If you have not received the confirmation, please e-mail <a href="mailto:training@netsuite.com" data-linktrack="true" data-tracklinktext="trainingEmail">training@netsuite.com</a>.

                        <p><strong>What audio options can I use for Virtual Training sessions?</strong><br>
                           You may use integrated WebEx VoIP to connect to the audio portion of the training session, or dial in on the phone. If you elect to connect using VoIP, you should have a computer headset with a microphone and functioning audio on your computer prior to joining the session. Refer to the setup guide in <a href="https://system.netsuite.com/core/media/media.nl?id=9838097&amp;c=NLCORP&amp;h=4ef9a411c64e91f5d340&amp;_xt=.pdf&amp;addrcountry=US&amp;vid=k8xynORpAjhDlV9Q&amp;chrole=17&amp;ck=U05akeRpAjVDlcCn&amp;cktime=158203&amp;promocode=&amp;promocodeaction=overwrite" data-linktrack="true" data-tracklinktext="prepareVirtualTraining2">Prepare for Virtual Training</a>.

                        <p><strong>How do I access my Virtual Training session?</strong><br>

                        <p><strong>What breaks are available during a virtual session?</strong><br>
                           The sessions will have scheduled breaks. The Instructor will review the schedule during Introductions at the beginning of each course.
